Kornebari Nantah in a call



As submitted earlier (please see previous emails), I will resend records and billing to you.  We will wait until this Friday June 7th for a response, and will file a complaint to Texas Department of Insurance to resolve the matter if no response is made by then.  Please note that this bill and exam is from a state ordered designated doctor exam which is mandatory payment or the risk of fines and penalties may occur.  Thanks.

Give a 48 hour window.
