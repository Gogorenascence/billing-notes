I need a description of each, common causes and symptoms of the following:
1. Right knee tear of lateral meniscus
2. ACL sprain
3. Right knee derangement
4. Right knee contusion
5. Rupture of articular cartilage of knee joint


I'd like them to be formatted similar to this:
A SLAP tear (Superior Labrum Anterior and Posterior tear) is an injury to the labrum, which is the ring of cartilage that surrounds the socket of the shoulder joint. The "SLAP" acronym refers to the location of the tear: Superior (top part of the labrum), Labrum (the cartilage ring), Anterior (front part) and Posterior (back part).

SLAP tears occurs at the top part of the labrum where the biceps tendon attaches, and it can extend to both the front and back of this attachment.

Common causes are repetitive overhead motion (like throwing), trauma, such as a fall on an outstretched arm, sudden pulling (like trying to catch a heavy object) and degeneration from aging.

Symptoms may include deep shoulder pain, especially with overhead movement, catching, locking, or popping sensations, decreased shoulder strength, limited range of motion, and pain with lifting or throwing.
