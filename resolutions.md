This functional capacity exam was referred to me by the designated doctor Andre Hwang, DC. This exam was ordered to determine the correct work status of the claimant and under the following TDI rule, the exam can be performed without an need preauthorization:


Texas Administrative Code- Rule 126.7 (K)

The designated doctor shall perform additional testing or refer an employee to other healthcare providers when necessary to determine the issue in question. Any additional testing required for the evaluation is not subject to preauthorization requirements in accordance with the labor code 413.014 or insurance code, chapter 1305.


Attached is the DWC-060, original billing and report for the patient James Juarez.
